# Development of a Single Page Application

## Requirements

- Create a free test account on https://newsapi.org/. This gives you access to a simple news api.
- Build a Single Page Application with a frontend framework like VueJS, React or Angular containing a search field that makes it possible to search for news. If you perform a search the first 10 results shall be displayed in a user friendly list with the relevant fields (date, text/snippet, title, link, author).
- BONUS: With a paging function it shall be possible to show the next/previous 10 results. The page size can be adjusted between 5/10/20 results per page.

## Tech

The technologies you use as well as the design of the application can be freely chosen by
you. You need to work on the task alone.
